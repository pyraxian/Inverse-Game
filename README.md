# Inverse-Game

This is a puzzle game I built for my undergrad senior project. 
Whereas most traditional puzzle games can be described as "move some object around a stage to a goal," Inverse reverses this by having the player rotate circular stage to manipulate the goals into the positions of the ojbects.
